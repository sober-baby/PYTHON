"""The Credit Card Simulator starter code
You should complete every incomplete function,
and add more functions and variables as needed.
Ad comments as required.

Note that incomplete functions have 'pass' as the first statement:
pass is a Python keyword; it is a statement that does nothing.
This is a placeholder that you should remove once you modify the function.
